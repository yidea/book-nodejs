# Node.js Essential (Gitbook)

While coding and learning Node.js, always want to document what I learned and contribute back to community. Node.js Essential is published w Gitbook for free.

### Node.js Pros vs. Cons
- __Pros__: 
  * Best for Large I/O, real-time, high performance need. Nonblocking async I/O data-intensive real-time app(Nasdaq, Chat, Websocket, Ads distribution, Game server), mobile mid layer(wrapping data source api, proxy), RESTful web api/scraping, socket.io, node-webkit. 
  * Event-driven programming style. 
  * Isomophic, NPM, FE javascript developer can quick grasp 

- __Cons__: single thread, callback hell w event loop, CPU bound (image encoding, e.g. calculate fibonacci(57) without memorize)
